## Performance Improvements

### Module graph construction is now 3000x faster! 🚀

Dramatically improved module graph build performance through two key optimizations:

**Before:** ~1850ms to analyze `build.zig` (loading 308 modules from std with ZIR)
**After:** ~0.6ms to analyze `build.zig` (loading 2 modules without ZIR)

**What changed:**

1. **Disabled ZIR generation** - ZIR was added proactively in v0.4.0 for future control flow analysis (issue #18), but no rules currently use it. Generating ZIR took 10-50ms per module.

2. **Skip recursing into std library** - When linting user code like `build.zig`, we don't need to parse all 300+ modules from the standard library. Now we only load the root `std.zig` file.

**Impact on real-world usage:**

```bash
# Linting a single file that imports std
Before: ~2 seconds
After:  ~0.4 seconds (5x faster)

# Linting entire src/ directory
Before: Previously slow on large projects
After:  Dramatically faster startup and analysis
```

These optimizations can be easily reverted if control flow analysis is implemented in the future (see well-documented code comments in `src/ModuleGraph.zig`).

## Technical Details

- ZIR generation infrastructure remains in place and can be re-enabled by uncommenting documented code sections
- Module graph now loads only user code + top-level std.zig instead of recursively parsing the entire standard library
- All tests pass; linter functionality unchanged
- Verified against GitHub history: ZIR added in commit 14bbe87 but never used by any rules
