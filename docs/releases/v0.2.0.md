## What's New

### New Rules

- **Z017**: Flag redundant `try` in return statements (`return try expr` → `return expr`)
- **Z018**: Flag redundant `@as` when type is already known from context
- **Z019**: `@This()` in named struct; use the type name instead
- **Z020**: Inline `@This()`; assign to a constant first
- **Z021**: File-struct `@This()` alias should match filename
- **Z022**: `@This()` alias in anonymous/local struct should be `Self`

### Improvements

- Z006: Treat error set merges as type aliases
- TypeResolver: Support aliased std imports
- Fix Z017 message dim color leak
- Fix addLint caching by using LazyPath

### Removed Rules

- Z008: Comment divider line rule (removed)
