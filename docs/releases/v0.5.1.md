## Bug Fixes

### Z011: Fixed deprecation detection in nested contexts

Previously, ziglint failed to detect deprecated function calls inside `try` expressions, `catch` blocks, and other nested AST contexts. This was due to incomplete AST traversal in the linter.

**Fixed detection for:**
- `std.meta.intToEnum()` - deprecated in favor of `@enumFromInt()`
- `std.meta.TagPayloadByName()` - deprecated in favor of `TagPayload` with `@field()`
- `std.enums.nameCast()` - deprecated in favor of `@enumFromInt(@intFromEnum())`
- `std.unicode.utf8Decode()` - deprecated in favor of `utf8DecodeAssumeValid()`
- And many other deprecated functions that were previously missed

**Technical details:**
- Fixed `visitChildren()` to recursively visit all child nodes for unhandled AST node types
- Now catches deprecations in try expressions, catch blocks, and other complex contexts
- Added test corpus to prevent regressions

**Example - now detects:**
```zig
pub fn main() !void {
    // Previously missed, now detected:
    _ = try std.meta.intToEnum(MyEnum, 1);
}
```

### Code Quality

- Fixed Z011 violation in ziglint's own codebase: replaced deprecated `std.mem.trimLeft` with `std.mem.trimStart`
- Fixed Z007 violations: eliminated 20 duplicate `ModuleGraph` imports across test functions
- Added test cases for deprecated functions we don't yet detect (marked as skipped for future work)

## Improvements

- Added `--verbose` flag with timing information for performance analysis
- Added per-rule timing breakdown to verbose output
- Improved verbose output with colors and rule summary
- Better directory linting with verbose logging

## Known Limitations

Detection still requires improvement for:
- Deprecated methods on local variables (requires flow analysis)
- Deprecated const values that aren't function calls

## Installation

```bash
mise use github:rockorager/ziglint@v0.5.1
```

Or download pre-built binaries from the release assets.
